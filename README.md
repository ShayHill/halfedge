# A somewhat typical halfedges data structure.

The big difference is holes. A "triangle" mesh in 2D will never be entirely triangular (and also manifold). There will be a boundary around the triangles. This library keeps track of these holes and tries to keep them out of your way.

`edge.hole` may show a hole or face, but `vert.faces` and `mesh.faces` will not list holes. In these cases, holes should be safe to ignore. 

A proper half-edge data structure stores:

* a set of verts (redundant)
* for each vert, a pointer to an edge
* a set of edges
* for each edge, pointers to vert, pair, face, next
* a set of faces (redundant)
* for each face, a pointer to an edge

This implementation only stores a set of edges. Sets of verts and faces are generated by iterating through references
in edge instances. This makes for slower code, but does not violate DRY and makes for dramatically cleaner code.

This means that verts and faces disappear from a mesh when the edges referencing them are removed.

Also means that this won't be useful for more than hundreds (maybe thousands) of edges. Good enough for my purposes.
