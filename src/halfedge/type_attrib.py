"""Attribute values that know how to merge with each other.

As a mesh is transformed, Verts, Edges, and Faces will be split or combined with each
other. Different attributes will combine in different ways, for instance:

    * a new vert between two boundary verts might produce another boundary vert,
      while a new vert between a boundary vert and a non-boundary vert might produce a
      non-boundary vert.
    * a new vert between two verts with defined vectors might hold the average of
      those two vectors
    * two faces with defined areas might combine into a new face with the sum of those
      two areas
    * expensive attributes might be cached

The MeshElement classes in this library don't support inheritance (with proper
typing), because the mess involved adds too much complication. If you need to extend
the Vert, Edge, Face, or HalfEdges classes with additional attributes, you will need
to define each attribute as a descendent of Attrib.

    class MyAttrib(Attrib[something]):
        ...
        def merge [define how multiple instances of this attribute will combine]
        def split [define how this attribute will be passed when the element is split]
        def _infer_value [define how to calculate the value if not set]

    vert = Vert()
    vert.set_attrib(MyAttrib('value'))
    assert vert.get_attrib(MyAttrib).value == 'value'

These attributes are held in an instance attribute dict, `attrib` keyed to the class
name of the attribute.

    assert vert.get_attrib(MyAttrib).value == 'value'
    assert vert.attrib['MyAttrib'].value == 'value'

Rules governing combination of these properties are defined in the Attrib classes
themselves.

There is a base class, Attrib, here, plus some subclasses modelling common cases. Do
not use these classes directly. Instead, subclass one of these classes for each
attribute you need to define.

        square. To keep this safe, the _value is calculated *before* any merging. In
        the "area of a triangle" example,
